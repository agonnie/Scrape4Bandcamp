# Scraper4Bandcamp



Scraper4Bandcamp is a simple Python program that exploits the fact that Bandcamp's Embedded Player doesn't hide its source links for songs.

It all started with me trying to download <a href="https://chinesefootball.bandcamp.com/album/chinese-football">this album</a> as a poor student circa 2016. I have recently tidied it up and decided to release it.

Bandcamp is aware of this but believe that it is not detrimental to artists as it leads to more people listening to their music. (yes I know it's 128kbps)

In the future I would like to implement:
+ Metadata editing
+ Ensuring that it can deal with unicode
+ Embeded album art
+ Make this an executable so that it is easier to use
